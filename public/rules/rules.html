    <h1>Rules of the game</h1>
    <p>
        The objective of the game is to be the first one to reach 10.000 points and thereby declare
        themself the winner
    </p>

    <h3>The game</h3>
    <p>The game is played with 6 normal dice and some way of keeping track of points</p>

    <h3>Scoring:</h3>
    <p>
        The point scoring system is pretty simple and should be easy to understand and learn.
        <br />The following is true:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Single 5's is worth <b>50</b> points</li>
        <li>Single 1's is worth <b>100</b> points</li>
        <li>
            Three of one kind is worth <b>eyes * 100</b> <i>(Three 2's = 200)</i> except 1's which
            is worth <b>1000</b> points
        </li>
        <li>
            Three+ of a kind are rolled, each additional die is worth as much again as the three of
            a kind score <i>(Three 4's = 400, Four 4's = 400 + 400)</i>
        </li>
        <li>All numbers from 1 to 6 gives <b>1500</b> points</li>
        <li>Three pairs is worth <b>1000</b> points <i>(2+2,3+3,5+5)</i></li>
        <li>
            <b>SPECIAL RULE: </b>If a player roll all 6 of a kind, (in one roll) its an automatic
            win
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Winning:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Option 1: </b>The first player to reach 10.000 is declared the temporary winner, as each
        player get 1 turn to get over that score. <br /><b>Option 2: </b> The winner have to reach
        exactely 10.000 points<br />
        Each player not at 10.000 points, will only get 1 extra turn, even if another player beats
        the temporary winners score.
